# blst

This is a proof-of-concept wrapper of SupraNational BLST library https://github.com/supranational/blst
The wrapper is being integrated directly in our BLSCurve as an optimized alternative BLS backend https://github.com/status-im/nim-blscurve

As such this wrapper is unmaintained.

## Installation

You can install the developement version of the library through nimble with the following command
```
nimble install https://github.com/status-im/nim-blst@#master
```
